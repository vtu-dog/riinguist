Riichi Mahjong linguist bot for Discord

- [Overview](#overview)

## Overview
I've recently started playing Riichi Mahjong with friends (it's a great game, give it a try!) and learned most of the definitions in Japanese, much to the dismay of everyone using the English terminology.

No more confusion. Type `!explain X` in your Discord server and you'll be provided with a definition of `X` straight from [riichi.wiki](https://riichi.wiki/).

## Additional info
The project was tested using Rust 1.55.0 (Stable) on macOS 11.6 Big Sur (arm64).
